# Luhn Algorithm - C++ Project

This C++ project is an application for verifying credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. The Luhn algorithm is commonly used to validate credit card numbers and ensure their validity.

## Features

- Verification of the validity of a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.
- Display of the verification result (valid or invalid).
- Support for credit card numbers of different lengths.

## Usage


1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3pacc/Credit_Card_Validator.git


2. Compile the C++ program:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o Credit_Card_Validator


3. Run the program with a credit card number to verify:
    ```bash
    ./Credit_Card_Validator <credit_card_number>
